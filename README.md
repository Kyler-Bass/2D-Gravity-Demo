# 2D-Gravity-Demo

A 2D demonstration of gravity created using Python and PyGame. This is not a 100% accurate demostration in order to allow for more than a few hundred objects on the screen at one time.

## You will Need Python and Pygame Installed

- Install Python from their website
- Open command Prompt and type in `pip3 install pygame` to install pygame

## To Use The Demo

**1.** You will need to open the project folder in command prompt or in an IDE

**2.** You will then need to run `main.py`

**3.** In the terminal you will be prompted to input different values that will be used to create the demonstration. None of them are required and will default to predetermined values if you leave them blank.

**4.** The demo window will then pop up and you will be able to click anywhere on the screen to create new objects. There will be a small explosion graphic whenever two points collide, and the points will then become one with a larger mass. Any points that go off screen will be deleted.
